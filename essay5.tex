Berkeley is an amazing place to pursue a PhD.
Our computer science (CS) program ties for first place with Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon\footnote{http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings}.  
Berkeley prioritizes long-term research projects; therefore, most graduate students here are pursuing a PhD.
Stanford has more of an entrepreneurial focus, and many students pay to get a non-research master's degree.
Berkeley is an all-around top institution\footnote{http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2010/09/28/nrc-rankings/}, so we produce high-quality interdisciplinary work.
The AMP Lab, where I work, leverages the availability of excellent collaborators in other areas to find big data applications.
Carnegie Mellon and MIT are predominantly technical universities (their strongest programs are in engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences) and therefore lack the advantage of top departments in every field.

Getting a PhD from Berkeley will give me strong preparation for entering the job market, largely because of the people I encounter.
My advisor has made seminal achievements in CS (e.g., RAID, a technology for utilizing multiple hard drives; RISC, a simplified processor instruction set that enables huge efficiency gains), and I am currently collaborating with a Turing Award winner (highest honor in CS) on a genomics project.
My fellow students are incredible; they are some of the smartest people I have ever met, and I have learned a ton from them.
In the AMP Lab, we have faculty and students from various subdisciplines in CS (e.g., machine learning, networks, systems, databases).
This diversity helps us find research opportunities that others miss.
Our lab has a tradition of taking semi-annual retreats with our industrial sponsors, so we get regular practice presenting our work in a supportive environment.
This is great training for presenting my work at conferences.
We also have invaluable networking opportunities with folks in academia (visitors to the lab) and industry (attendees at the retreats) which will help us to find jobs when we graduate.

My education will enable me to be a person of influence within the field.
My advisors encourage me to pursue problems that impact our discipline and the sciences.
In addition, they enjoy supervising and teaching students.
Rather than resenting these duties, they make a serious effort to excel, and they have given me opportunities to build these skills.
My advisors allowed me to hire two undergraduate research assistants.
I had the opportunity to serve as a TA twice, with two different professors.
Berkeley is helping me grow as a researcher, manager, and teacher, and I believe this will help me to be successful in my career.
